월드 좌표계

8-second continuous cinematic: dawn-blue minimalist Korean living room, slow 35 mm push-in on a 60-year-old woman who softly wonders in Korean if it’s pill time; at 2 s the AI hub LED triple-pulses and a warm female voice replies “지금 드실 시간이에요” while a **3-D holographic pill bottle and gentle heart icon** bloom above the device—absolutely no written text or numbers—camera keeps pushing as her face relaxes, gold-pink particle ribbon and floating 3-D info icons (calendar, sun, walking figure) stream from hub toward the window, palette shifts to sunset-gold and blooms to white; under soft felt-piano, LED chirp, and airy whoosh SFX, English VO says: “When you suddenly feel lonely, AI becomes your dearest friend—reminding you to take your medicine and opening a world of helpful information to brighten your day.”
