인트로
Open with a shot of a single drop of water falling into a still pond. The ripples gently expand outwards, symbolizing the initial, subtle impact of AI on our lives. Over this, a soft, warm light gradually illuminates the scene, revealing abstract, interconnected networks of glowing lines forming diverse **Korean** silhouettes representing different age groups and walks of life (a **Korean** student in school uniform, a **Korean** professional in business attire, a **Korean** parent with a child's hand, a **Korean** senior in traditional clothing). The movement is slow and graceful, suggesting a unifying force. As the narration "AI, 더 나은 삶을 향한 부드러운 물결" (AI, A Gentle Wave Towards a Better Life) begins (audio only), the abstract silhouettes become slightly more defined, each subtly interacting with gentle streams of light emanating from the central AI network. The overall tone is hopeful, serene, and emphasizes connection and shared progress. The final visual focuses on the expanding ripples encompassing all the **Korean** silhouettes, signifying AI's inclusive potential for the **Korean** community. **The aesthetic should be clean, modern, and evoke a sense of calm optimism and shared future for Koreans.**

A tired-looking 18-year-old girl Korean high school student sits at a desk piled with open textbooks, looking stressed and rubbing their eyes. They pick up a sleek, glowing tablet. On the tablet screen, a cute, friendly, stylized AI robot character appears, standing in front of a dynamic, glowing virtual blackboard. The AI robot uses animated gestures and vivid 3D diagrams, flowing charts, and abstract visual metaphors to explain complex concepts on the blackboard. For incorrect quiz answers, the robot might show a gentle 'thinking' animation, then dynamically re-illustrate the concept with a new visual approach. When the student gets a correct answer, the robot might give a visual 'thumbs up' or a celebratory animation, and the blackboard fills with bright, encouraging visual cues like animated stars or a 'mastered' icon. The student's facial expression visibly shifts from stressed and frustrated to focused, curious, and finally relieved and happy, indicated by a relaxed posture and a smile. The entire AI tutor interface on the tablet remains purely visual, conveying all information through the AI robot's actions, animated diagrams, and positive reinforcement animations, with absolutely no visible text or numbers in any language. The cozy, modern study room is bathed in soft, natural light, emphasizing the supportive and comfortable learning environment. The camera focuses on the student's changing expressions and their interaction with the visually engaging AI robot tutor.

in a bright, modern meeting room setting, a slightly nervous but determined 25-year-old Korean girl job seeker is practicing a live mock interview. She sits facing a sleek, glowing tablet or monitor. The screen displays a dynamic, glowing **AI interview coach interface**. This interface features a **friendly, stylized, abstract AI assistant character (like a glowing orb or a subtle, non-humanoid avatar)** that visually analyzes and interacts with her performance.  
As the candidate speaks, the AI assistant on screen actively provides **real-time, interactive visual feedback using vivid 3D graphics, flowing lines, and animated icons, with absolutely no visible text or numbers in any language**:  

- **Posture Correction:** A subtle, translucent 3D human silhouette on screen might appear behind her camera view, gently guiding her posture. Or, a simple glowing "up arrow" animation appears if she slouches, then a soft green "check" icon materializes when she corrects it, all depicted with smooth, fluid motion.
- **Eye Contact Guidance:** A dynamic 3D graphic of two glowing, abstract eye shapes or a shifting target icon on screen gently nudges her gaze towards the camera's optimal point, perhaps with a subtle beam of light indicating the correct focus area.
- **Voice Projection & Tone Analysis:** Abstract, colorful sound waves or a dynamic "volume bar" visually undulate and change color to indicate voice levels and tone (e.g., warm colors for confident tone, cooler colors for hesitant tone). A subtle "boost" animation might appear when projection is good.
- **Facial Expression Feedback:** The AI might reflect her emotional state through subtle changes in its own abstract form or by displaying simple, universally recognized emotion icons (like a smiling or a thoughtful face, without text) that subtly mirror or guide her expressions.

The candidate's initial nervousness visibly dissipates, transitioning to focused engagement and growing confidence as she continuously responds to the AI's purely visual, interactive cues. The scene maintains a professional yet supportive atmosphere, emphasizing the direct, empowering interaction between the human candidate and the intelligent AI coach. The camera focuses intimately on the candidate's changing expressions and her direct, responsive interaction with the visually engaging AI interview tutor, highlighting the transformative effect of AI assistance in building interview confidence. All feedback and information are conveyed solely through dynamic and interactive graphics, abstract 3D elements, and smooth animations, with **no on-screen text or language** appearing at any point in the video.

For a Korean couple in their 30s who are busy with childcare and housework, AI smart home is a great help. When you give a voice command to **AI smart speaker**, the rice cooker will preheat and the air purifier will operate. The robot vacuum cleaner will quietly help with housework, and AI will notify you of the baby monitoring status and support childcare.

Health is the basis of happiness. Korean men in their 50s thoroughly check their health status through **AI-based wearable devices**. The smartwatch screen displays real-time heart rate, steps, and personalized health insights, and the AI ​​trainer suggests customized exercise programs and diets along with encouraging messages. The way they prepare for an active, healthy, and active senior life under the continuous monitoring and guidance of AI shows how much AI helps in health management.

8-second continuous cinematic: dawn-blue minimalist Korean living room, slow 35 mm push-in on a 60-year-old woman who softly wonders in Korean if it’s pill time; at 2 s the AI hub LED triple-pulses and a warm female voice replies “지금 드실 시간이에요” while a **3-D holographic pill bottle and gentle heart icon** bloom above the device—absolutely no written text or numbers—camera keeps pushing as her face relaxes, gold-pink particle ribbon and floating 3-D info icons (calendar, sun, walking figure) stream from hub toward the window, palette shifts to sunset-gold and blooms to white; under soft felt-piano, LED chirp, and airy whoosh SFX, English VO says: “When you suddenly feel lonely, AI becomes your dearest friend—reminding you to take your medicine and opening a world of helpful information to brighten your day.”
